Sparkle and Remote Activity building


The Sparkle framework is only added as a "reference" in the project. The framework was **NOT** included in the project folder, so as not to "pollute" the source directory (also, the framework is quite big, adding a significant amount to the repository size, which seems to be limited by Google??). Right now, it is referenced as an absolute path to '/Library/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework', which means developers will have to upload it separately and put it there for the build to work.

Maybe we should change that? Include it in the source files? Change the reference path?
